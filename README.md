# numpy-and-pandas
1.	Use various functions under Numerical Python to execute the following instructions.


a.	Generate a 2 by 3 matrix containing elements from 1 to 6 and multiply it by a scaler of two.  
b.	Create a 3 by 3 identity matrix
c.	Create a 1-D array call arry1 which contains elements ranging from zero to twenty-seven. Convert arry1 to a 3-D arry2
d.	Create two 2-D arrays with the first array containing elements from 1 to 6 and the second array containing elements from 7 to 12. Horizontally stack the two arrays together.  Using the same set of arrays vertically stack the two arrays
e.	Create an equally spaced sequence with a gap of 5 ranging from 0 to 100


2.	Use various Functions associated with Pandas to answer the following questions. 

a.	Create a DataFrame named as students using a list of names of 5 students.
b.	Write a program to create a DataFrame teams using a list of names of Ghana Premier League Teams and the goals they scored in their previous five matches.
c.	Write a program to create a DataFrame countries using a dictionary which stored country name, capitals, and populations of the country. Do this for West African Countries. 
d.	Consider the following data and write a programme to capture the data in python.
